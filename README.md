# Current libnode packages for Ubuntu and Debian

This repository contains the scripts used to generate the Ubuntu and Debian packages of `libnode`

Ubuntu PPA: https://launchpad.net/~mmomtchev/+archive/ubuntu/libnode

These packages include [PR#43542](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43542) allowing to embed the Node.js entirely through the binary stable Node-API from both C and C++. This PR might or might not get merged (it is currently under discussions).

The packages have been developed and are maintained as part of GSoC 2022 by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation and are copyright by Google and distributed under MIT License.
